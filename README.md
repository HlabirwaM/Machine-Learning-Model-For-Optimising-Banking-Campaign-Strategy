# Machine-Learning-Model-For-Optimising-Banking-Campaign-Strategy

This project involves machine learning with the objective of creating a predictive model capable of determining whether a customer will subscribe to a financial product (specifically, a term deposit) using 
data obtained from a Portuguese bank. The entire process adheres to the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, with meticulous documentation at each stage. The primary aim is to showcase a comprehensive grasp 
of applying machine learning techniques to address genuine business challenges.
